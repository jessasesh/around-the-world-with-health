# Around the World with Health

## Project Context

This project is developed as part of a **team challenge** under the theme **"Around the World!"**. Leveraging the skills acquired over the past two trimesters, this project involves building a complete **API** from start to finish, including design, development, and delivery. The focus is on teamwork, scope management, and creating a meaningful product within a limited timeframe.

Our interpretation of the **"Around the World!"** theme centers on promoting **global health awareness** through activities and sports. The API provides data on **countries**, **physical activities**, and **national sports** to inspire users to stay active while exploring cultural diversity.

---

## What is it you are going to build, and how does it fit the theme?

We are building an **API** that serves as a resource for health-conscious users to discover global activities and sports. The API will feature endpoints that provide:

1. **Countries**:
   - Basic details about countries worldwide.

2. **Activities**:
   - A variety of global physical and recreational activities that encourage healthy living.

3. **National Sports**:
   - Information about culturally significant sports and activities recognized in different countries.

### Theme Fit
This project fits the **"Around the World!"** theme by:
- Encouraging users to learn about physical activities and sports from different cultures.
- Promoting an understanding of global traditions while fostering healthy habits.
- Offering an educational yet practical resource for developers, fitness enthusiasts, and educators to build applications based on health and cultural awareness.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Backend Development**:
   - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
   - **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and handling API requests.
   - **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
   - **CORS**: For cross-origin resource sharing.

2. **Data**:
   - Static JSON files for quick and simple data management:
     - `countries.json`
     - `activities.json`
     - `national_sports.json`

3. **Development Tools**:
   - **Nodemon**: For live-reloading during development.
   - **Logger**: Middleware for tracking server activities.

4. **Testing**:
   - **Postman**: For testing and debugging API endpoints.
   - **Mocha/Chai or Jest**: For writing unit tests (optional).
